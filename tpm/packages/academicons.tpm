It requires the fontspec package and either the Xe(La)TeX or the Lua(La)TeX engine to load “Academicons” font from the system, which requires installing the bundled academicons.ttf font file. As new releases come out, it is recommended to install the bundled font version as there may be differences between the package and previous font versions or newer font versions not yet contemplated in the package. The “Academicons” font was designed by James Walsh and released (see http://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/) under the SIL Open Font License. This package is a redistribution of the free “Academicons” font with specific bindings for (La)TeX. It is inspired by and based on the fontawesome package. academicons.sty provides the generic \aiicon command to access icons, which takes as a mandatory argument the name of the desired icon. It also provides individual direct commands for each specific icon. The full list of icons and their respective names and direct commands can be found in the manual.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="33922">texmf\fonts\truetype\academicons\academicons.ttf texmf\tex\latex\academicons\academicons.sty texmf\tpm\packages\academicons.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="84138">texmf\doc\fonts\academicons\academicons.pdf texmf\doc\fonts\academicons\README</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="2193">texmf\source\academicons-src.tar.bz2</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1465934475</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>2c0725a2cb1edda9ca9d060e7a34a069</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/fonts/academicons"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Diogo A.
